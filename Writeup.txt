In this project, we ran a simple node server locally to display login fields. The user can input their username and passwords, then login with these credentials. We stored the registration information in a MongoDB database to recall registered users. The program checks the user's login from the database to authenticate the user.
To run the project, the user can install node and run the node command on backend.js, then open localhost:3000 in browser.
